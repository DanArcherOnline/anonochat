## How does it work?

Choose a display name to enter the chat room with.
Your display name will be displayed above all messages you send.
On your device, your messages will be displayed on the right, and messages from other users are displayed on the left.

### Test it yourself!
To test it out, start the app with 2 devices/emulators, with 2 different display names (no display name differentiation checks...), and start chatting!
